## Who **What** Where When How


- Open source
- Version Control System
- Distributed
- designed for speed and efficiency


---

### [fit] **What** : Version Control System

> A version control system tracks the history of changes on __shared__ projects.

Contributors can review project history to find out:

- Which changes were made?
- Who made the changes?
- When were the changes made?
- Why were changes needed?


---

### [fit] **What** : Distributed



- Distributed version control system donâ€™t need a constant connection to a central repository.
<br>
- Instead of copies of remote repository there are local repositories.

> It's your responsibility to keep sync your local repositories and your remotes.

## Who What **Where** When How

#### Be careful not to confuse Git with Git **hosting repositories** :

>  **GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket**

#### Be careful not to confuse Git with Git GUI clients :

> SourceTree, GitHub Desktop, TortoiseGit ...
